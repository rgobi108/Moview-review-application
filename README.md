# Moview-review-application
The movie review backend code was developed using Java and Spring Boot, with MongoDB as the database. The application utilized various dependencies including Spring Boot Starter, Spring Boot Web, Spring Boot JPA MongoDB, and Lombok. 

The Spring Boot Starter dependency provided a solid foundation for building the backend, offering essential configurations and auto-configuration capabilities. The Spring Boot Web dependency enabled the implementation of RESTful APIs and the handling of HTTP requests and responses. 

To interact with the MongoDB database, the Spring Boot JPA MongoDB dependency was used, allowing for seamless integration and efficient data management. This dependency facilitated object-document mapping, simplifying the interaction between the Java code and the MongoDB database.

The Lombok dependency played a crucial role in reducing boilerplate code by automatically generating getter and setter methods, constructors, and other repetitive code structures. This resulted in cleaner and more concise code, enhancing development productivity.

By leveraging these dependencies, the movie review backend code was efficiently implemented, ensuring seamless communication with the frontend and smooth data management within the MongoDB database.
